# Ziggy's Compressed Blocks

A light Minecraft mod that adds various compressed blocks for convenience and block variety.
The goal isn't to compress every block, or recursive compressions, as these mods exist already 

## Building / Installing

Run
`./gradew runDatagen && ./gradlew build`

The mod will be placed in `build/libs/
Copy the .jar file to your Minecraft mods folder. Ignore the sources file

## Contributing

Pull requests and suggestions are welcome! New blocks can easily be added by adding it to the ModBlocks.java file and adding a texture to `src/main/resources/assets/textures/`
